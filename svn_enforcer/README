# Important considerations for running svn_enforcer.
1) It uses certain python libraries/functions defined in pylib folder
2) It uses a svn.cfg configuration file

The svn.cfg file should look like the following:
[analytics]
path="/var/lib/mysqllog/working/analytics/"
email="email@gmail.com, email2@gmail.com, email3@gmail.com"
[ML]
path="/var/lib/mysqllog/working/ML/"
email="email@gmail.com"
[Scraping]
path="/var/lib/mysqllog/working/Scraping/"
email="email@gmail.com"
~                           

Note, each path should be a SVN working copy. SVN working copies can be created as follows, for example:
svn co https://mysvn.com:18080/path/of/repo --username=myun --force /path/of/working-copy/
# To set global proplist:
svn propedit svn:global-ignores
add following:
*.zip
*.cfg
*.log

Reports will be sent to emails listed under email variable.
Each report should begin with "[]" definition. 

Example Crontab:
30 9 * * * /usr/bin/python2.7 /path/to/svn_enforcer.py > /path/for/svn.log 2>&1
